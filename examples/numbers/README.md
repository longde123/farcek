## Number Parsing Example

Here is a parser that accepts strings like `"five million two hundred thirty-eight thousand nine hundred seventy-six"` returns the integer `5238976`.

To run the example code, just cd into this directory and do something like

```bash

haxe -cp ../../src -main Main -python main.py
python3 main.py


```

which is what I do on my system.
